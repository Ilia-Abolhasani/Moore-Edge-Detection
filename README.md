# Moore Edge Detection

This repository contains a straightforward Python implementation of the Moore Neighborhood Algorithm for edge detection. It's designed for learning purposes and requires the following dependencies:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

To install the required packages, you can use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
```
Explore the Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step demonstration of Moore Neighborhood Edge Detection on sample images.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with edge detection on your own images!

## Usage
